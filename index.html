          <h2>Confident, Bold, Ready</h2>
          <p>
            Enthusiastic and motivated student eager for new cahllenges looking
            to dive into the world of development. Passionate person who wants
            to learn new skills and improve existing ones. I would make up lack
            of experience with hard work and great dedication. As a person I am
            very open, positive and communicative. I love to joke and laugh, but
            also I am direct, organized and abstract thinking person who loves
            problem solving. Through smaller projects I have shown to function
            well both in a team as well as an individual. I am quite versatile
            person with a lot of interests. Your academy looks like a great
            opportunity for me and my further development.

          <p>
            <strong>Histroy</strong> - I have a great passion for history and I
            love spending time exploring various battles, events and different
            periods. Acquired knowledge gives a great perspective on many things
            and expands the ability to connect different concepts. That combined
            with cause-and-effect relationships tracking, one can truly answer
            many how and why questions of the modern world.

        <div class="interest_block">
          <p>
            <strong>Automotive Industry</strong> - I always had interest in cars
            and vehicles in general. I own a car and i love working on it, and I
            find driving a car very enjoyable. There is something special about
            1.5 tons of carbon fiber/steel/aluminum gliding through corners, as
            you shift through gears smoothly and accelerate fast while the
            engine screams.. or it is just me

        </div>
        <div class="interest_block">
          <p>
            <strong>Technology</strong> - Passionate about technology in
            general, especially in areas of artificial intelligence (AI),
            computer hardware, 3d printers and 3d modeling and blockchain
            technology. I was always found of trying and exploring different
            software programs. Modern day ability to automate tasks, both small
            like running some small code with a script, to a large robot-only
            facotires is just fascinating.
